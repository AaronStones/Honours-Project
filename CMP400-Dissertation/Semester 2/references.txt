Other studies demonstrated the smartphone’s potential in patient monitoring. Shoes fitted with sensors that communicate 
with the smartphone were used to follow the activity level of patients who have recently had a stroke [7]. 
The smartphone’s accelerometer can be used to interpret gait and balance of patients [8-11]. Another study entailed 
connecting a single-lead ECG to a smartphone to diagnose and follow treatment with sleep apnea [12], providing a possible 
alternative to costly and labor-intensive polysomnography. One study used smartphones to promote physical activity by asking 
participants to routinely log their results.

The ability to automatically monitor patients with diabetic and heart conditions from their smartphones is being developed [16]. 
This technology extends to other conditions such as movement disorders or bipolar disorder [17-19]. Additionally, engineers are 
testing the smartphone to be used as a device for monitoring patients’ balance using the phone’s accelerometer [20].

Several examples demonstrating the smartphone’s role in communication can be found in developing countries with scarce resources [45]. 
In Africa, the amount of network coverage to send text messages with pictures ranges from 1.5% to 92.2% [46], providing an opportunity 
to send pictures of physical findings to aid in telediagnosis. Pictures from phone cameras of Gram stains have been sent via text 
messaged for remote diagnosis [47]. Video clips of limited echocardiographic studies were taken in remote Honduran villages sent via 
iPhones to experts for interpretation [48]. This has been reproduced with lung ultrasound [49]. Engineers have created various microscopes 
that attach to smartphones, providing a cost-effective and mobile way to bring more technology to poor and rural regions [50-52]. 
Development of point-of-care apps for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection treatment to support physicians with limited HIV training 
in undeveloped regions is expected to minimize errors and improve outcomes [53].
